# **.NET and Azure Skills Demonstration Project**

This project serves as a showcase of the skills I have learned in my free time, particularly in **.NET** and **Azure** development. It demonstrates my ability to build a project that integrates a database, includes data access functionality, and explores essential development concepts.

## **What This Project Includes**
- **Database Access**:
  - Implemented functionality to connect to and interact with a database, including retrieving and managing its contents.

- **Authentication System**:
  - Developed an experimental authentication system. While functional, it is intended as a placeholder and could be replaced with a more robust, state-of-the-art solution in the future.

- **API Development and Testing**:
  - Designed and documented APIs using **Swagger**, ensuring clarity and consistency.
  - Tested API endpoints thoroughly using **Postman** to validate functionality and identify potential issues.

- **Core Technologies Used**:
  - **Entity Framework**: Simplified database interactions and ORM management.
  - **AutoMapper**: Streamlined the mapping of objects to enhance data handling and reduce boilerplate code.

## **What I Learned**
1. **Database Integration**:
   - How to access, query, and manage database contents efficiently.
2. **Authentication Principles**:
   - Explored the basics of authentication systems to handle user access control.
3. **API Design and Testing**:
   - Used **Swagger** to document APIs, ensuring a developer-friendly interface.
   - Leveraged **Postman** for endpoint testing, including request validation and debugging.
4. **Advanced .NET Features**:
   - Gained hands-on experience with **Entity Framework** for ORM tasks and **AutoMapper** for object mapping.
5. **Cloud Integration**:
   - Leveraged Azure services to host and deploy the project, enhancing my understanding of cloud-based application workflows.

## **Future Improvements**
- Replace the experimental authentication system with a cutting-edge, secure solution.
- Add unit tests to improve reliability and maintainability.
- Explore advanced Azure services for improved scalability and performance.
